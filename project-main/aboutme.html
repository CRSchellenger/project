            <p>My name is Christopher, but I go by chris. I got started in programmming by slow exposure through youtube,seeing ads for code academy and many others
            and now here i am. I love out door activites such as skate boarding,kayaking,fishing,camping,and hiking. I can be an inside guy sometimes I love music, playing the drums
            and watching some tv. I also like to build gaming computers and custom setups. My passion for learning is beyond reporach I always want to know how something works or how something
            goes together.</p>
